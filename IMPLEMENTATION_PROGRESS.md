- üîÑ **Input Validation:** Review and strengthen API endpoint validation
- üîÑ **Authentication Edge Cases:** Audit and fix auth flows

### 1.2 Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ **Testing Framework Setup:** Vitest + Testing Library configuration
- ‚úÖ **Basic Test Coverage:** ErrorBoundary, validation utilities, auth hook
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ‚è≥ **Critical Path Tests:** User flows, authentication, data operations

### Key Metrics - Phase 1
- **Bug Fix Coverage:** 0/4 critical items resolved
- **Test Coverage:** Target 80% for critical paths
- **Security Audit:** 0/3 auth flows verified

## Phase 2: Architecture Refinement ‚è≥ PENDING

### 2.1 Service Layer Refactor
- ‚è≥ Extract business logic from components
- ‚è≥ Implement proper service interfaces  
- ‚è≥ Add dependency injection container

### 2.2 Component Decomposition
- ‚è≥ Break down large components (AdminDashboard: 200+ lines)
- ‚è≥ Extract custom hooks for data fetching
- ‚è≥ Implement error handling patterns
