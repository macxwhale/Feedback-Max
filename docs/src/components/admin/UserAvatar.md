# UserAvatar.tsx

## Purpose
Displays a user's avatar, using their initials as a fallback if no image is available.

## Key Functionality
- Takes a user's email and an optional size as input.
- Uses the `getInitials` utility function to generate initials from the email address.
- Renders an `Avatar` component from the UI library.
- Displays the generated initials as a fallback within the avatar.
- Supports different size variations ('sm', 'md', or 'lg').

## Dependencies
- `@/components/ui/avatar` for the avatar component
- `@/utils/roleManagement` for the `getInitials` utility

## Relationship to other files
