# ConversationalAnalytics.tsx

## Purpose
Provides a conversational AI assistant interface within the admin dashboard for analyzing customer feedback data.

## Key Functionality
- Simulates a chat interface where users can ask questions about feedback data.
- Displays predefined "quick questions" as prompts.
- Manages the conversation flow, showing both user queries and simulated AI responses.
- Includes a basic simulated AI response generator that provides different responses based on keywords in the user's query.
- Displays simulated insights and recommendations within the AI's responses with different visual indicators.
- Shows a loading indicator while the AI is "processing".
- Utilizes a `ScrollArea` to manage the conversation history display.

## Dependencies
- lucide-react for icons
- `@/components/ui/*` for various UI components (Card, Button, Input, Badge, ScrollArea)

## Relationship to other files
Intended to be used within the admin dashboard as a tool for analyzing feedback data in a conversational manner. The AI responses and insights are currently simulated and would ideally integrate with actual analytics services.

### Component Details

  - organizationId: The ID of the organization whose data is being analyzed (although not currently used in the simulated logic).
