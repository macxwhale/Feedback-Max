## `src/components/admin/dashboard/DashboardErrorBoundary.tsx`

This file contains a React Error Boundary component specifically designed for the dashboard. It catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs the errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application. This improves the user experience by providing a graceful way to handle unexpected errors within the dashboard.

The `DashboardErrorBoundary` component uses `getDerivedStateFromError` to update the state when an error occurs and `componentDidCatch` to log the error information. The `handleRetry` function allows the user to attempt to reload the component that caused the error.

The file also exports a `DashboardErrorFallback` functional component, which is a simple, reusable UI to display when an error is caught by the error boundary. It includes an icon, a message, and a retry button.
